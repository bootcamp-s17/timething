Todo List

Set today as the default date for starttime and endtime








Make the two selects (client and category) depend on each other properly:
  * When client changes, wipe out category and replace it with the categorie of the new client

Need to be able to update and save activities

Need a list page for activities:
  * view
  * edit
  * delete

An activity is complete if it has an end time

Invoices:
  * "Create an invoice" assigns all complete activities to a new invoice for that client
  * Need to be marked as paid/unpaid
  * Delete a paid invoice? Probably not.
  * Delete an unpaid invoice makes all its activities available to invoice again




Done!

Can create a new category, but it always gets assigned to Bob's Garage (id = 12)

Active client id remains Bob's Garage even if I add a category to another client

Can't delete a category

When category saved, change last_update field

Update status message when categories are deleted, updated, and added

Can't save a category

When there are no categories, PHP displays an error after "Edit Categories" is clicked

Add a button for invoice generation (on client page)

Style on the home link on the clients page

Input validation for categories

Disable delete button for client if client has categories

Style the homepage
